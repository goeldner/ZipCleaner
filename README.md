# ZipCleaner

## TL;DR

This is a recompilation of the original ZipCleaner tool by Roger Jolly â€“ maintained to be
runnable on latest macOS versions.

ZipCleaner removes .DS_Store files and other resource information from zip archives.

## About

You might know and love the ZipCleaner tool, which was developed by Roger Jolly and
released as version 1.0 in the year 2007.

From the original help file:

> When you create a zip archive in the Finder, .DS_Store files and other resource
> information can be included. Although these are useful on a Mac, and will be invisible
> to the user, they show up when you unzip the archive on other operation systems, e.g.
> MS Windows. There these files are just meaningless garbage. ZipCleaner lets you remove
> them from the zip archives the Finder creates.

Starting with macOS Catalina (version 10.15), ZipCleaner could could not be used any
more, because it is available as 32-bit version only and Apple decided to only allow
64-bit software any more. Unfortunately, there is no new version available from Roger
Jolly since the initial release of version 1.0 in the year 2007. So I decided to take the
original source code and recompile it as 64-bit application with latest Xcode version.

Currently there is no plan to add new features. I try to maintain the build settings and
to apply some minor updates in order to keep it running on latest macOS versions.

## Releases

Released versions can be found here: https://github.com/goeldner/ZipCleaner/releases

The app is notarized by Apple.

## Installation

In order to install, just download and open the latest DMG file, then drag ZipCleaner.app
into the Applications folder.

You can start ZipCleaner from Applications folder. I keep it pinned to the dock. Zip
files can just be dragged onto the icon inside the dock and cleaning starts automatically.
